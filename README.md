# Linear-Regression
A project to understand and programatically implement linear regression and the mathematics behind it.


If you visualize the given x and y values, you will see a more or less precise straight line that depends on the accuracy of the given x and y values. This straight line or the slope of this straight line and thus the dependency of the x and y values is approximated with the linear regression. This straight line allows you to assign unknown y-values to an x-value.
When calculating the straight line, two parameters (a, b) are used, which can be calculated from the existing x and y values.
