# Linear-Regression

This is a project to understand and programatically implement linear regression and the mathematics behind it.

## The mathematics behind linear regression

If you visualize the given x and y values, you will see a more or less precise straight line that depends on the accuracy of the given x and y values. This straight line or the slope of this straight line and thus the dependency of the x and y values is approximated with the linear regression. This straight line allows you to assign unknown y-values to an x-value.
When calculating the straight line, two parameters (a, b) are used, which can be calculated from the existing x and y values.

A straight line is generally defined as follows by two parameters (a, b), where y is the y-value to be calculated, which corresponds to x, the already specified x-value.

The parameter b can be calculated as follows from the available x and y values, where the numerator of the fraction of the sum of x minus the x average multiplied by y minus the y average, for each x and y Value.

The calculation of parameter a is much easier than the calculation of parameter ö. B, but the calculation of; àParameter a, parameter b required. Parameter a is defined by the y-average minus parameter B multiplied by the x-average.
